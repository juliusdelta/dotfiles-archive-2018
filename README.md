# My Dotfiles

## Overview

This is my general configuration for Emacs, Zsh, Vim, & Tmux. There's still a few bugs here and there I'm working out. Emacs is my daily driver, but I use Vim here and there if it's more convienent. Everything I use is based on the [Nord Color theme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) which is just awesome. I've tried to ensure the theme is consistent throughout all of these dotfiles.

## Details

### Emacs

I'm using Evil-mode to give Vim like behavior and keybindings. It's really a hybrid of several things. I'm using [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), [Company Mode](http://company-mode.github.io/), [Smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens), [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org/), [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm), & [Magit](https://magit.vc/) with a few other random packages.
